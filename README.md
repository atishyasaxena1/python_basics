Python Input Basics  
This project includes a simple Python program that shows how to take user input, change data types (string, integer, float), and print the values in a formatted sentence. It is a beginner-friendly example for anyone starting to learn Python basics.

Features  
- Takes string input (name)  
- Takes integer input (age)  
- Takes float input (price)  
- Demonstrates typecasting using int() and float()  
- Uses basic print formatting  

How to Run the Program  
1. Install Python (if you haven't already).  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.  

Purpose of This Project  
This is my first Python program.  
It helps me practice:  
- taking user input  
- converting data types  
- printing output clearly  
- uploading code to GitHub  

Future Improvements  
- Add error handling  
- Add more input options  
- Add f-string formatting  
- Create more beginner Python programs
